Much of chemical oceanography and organic geochemistry is concerned in some way with the very small fraction of fixed organic matter that is preserved in sediments at the bottom of the sea. This organic matter must survive various destructive forces in the surface ocean and water column, all of which have the thermodynamic advantage. On timescales of millennia --- i.e., within the faster of Earth's two carbon cycles (Falkowski, 2014) --- the burial of the reduced carbon contained in this organic matter is the primary source (in a mass-balance sense) of atmospheric oxygen. On longer timescales, an even smaller fraction of this carbon survives to enter the Earth's lithosphere, which contains a massive $15\times10^6$ Pg of carbon (Petsch, 2014). Because of the importance of this small fraction of organic matter, it is no surprise that the various processes which determine its size and nature have been the subject of continual scientific investigation for centuries.

Although the ocean's biological pump was not formally defined as such until the late 20th century (Volk and Hoffert, 1985; Broecker, 1981), the hypothesis that the atmospheric and terrestrial compartments of the earth system could be connected in some meaningful way through chemical reactions in the oceans and hydrosphere first formally appeared in the late 19th century in the work of Arrhenius (1896), Chamberlin (1898), and contemporaries (Sundquist and Ackerman, 2014).\textsuperscript{1}\let\thefootnote\relax\footnote{{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}\textsuperscript{1} The more fundamental notion that the chemical constituents of seawater could be subject to cycles of input and output orignated with Perrault (1674), who drew on the work of the Greek philosophers (Mottl and Elderfield, 2014). A wonderful history of biogeochemistry, with attention to the many early scientific contributions that shaped the discipline's development, can be found in Gorham (1991).}} In 1924, Vernadsky made one of the earliest attempts to quantify the sizes of the various carbon reservoirs that are connected through this hydrological nexus. His estimate of the size of the lithospheric carbon reservoir, $8\times10^{16}$ metric tons (or $8\times10^7$ Pg), was remarkably close to modern estimates. Vernadsky's other major contribution was, of course, to propose the term \emph{biogeochemistry} to describe the transfers of energy and carbon between these reservoirs, and the effects of and consequences for biota within each. Among the first modern oceanographers to investigate the transfer of energy and carbon between various biogeochemically distinct regions of the ocean were Dugdale and Goering (1967) and Eppley and Peterson (1979), who introduced the concepts of new versus regenerated primary production in the surface ocean and then established the importance of the former for the export of particulate matter to the deep sea, respectively.

Among modern geochemists and chemical oceanographers whose primary domain is these sinking marine particles and marine sediments, scientific inquiry into the fate of organic matter originating in the surface ocean has often been framed in terms of remineralization (i.e., oxidation by one or more terminal electron acceptors) or selectivity (or non-selectivity) in the preservation of certain of its components (e.g., Berner, 1981; D. Krom and A. Berner, 1981; Hedges et al., 2001; Keil et al., 1994; Middelburg, 1989; see also Figure 1). Of particular interest to chemical oceanographers and geochemists in this regard are the lipids of marine plankton, biochemicals whose taxonomic specificity and functional diversity make them uniquely suited for use as biomarkers of particular taxa or biogeochemical processes (Close et al., 2013; Pearson, 2014; Rontani et al., 2012; Sturt et al., 2004; Wakeham et al., 1997). Lipids and their many oxidation products are equally useful as indicators of various processes and phenomena in living or senescent biomass (Hunter et al., 2015; Van Mooy et al., 2006; Van Mooy et al., 2009; Vardi et al., 2012). Implicit in the use of these molecules as biomarkers is the recognition that they may be shaped and transformed by diverse catabolic and diagenetic processes in the water column and (when persisting for sufficient time) in sediments (Killops and Killops, 2005).

It is when one moves closer to the ocean's surface --- as I have in the course of researching and writing this thesis --- that a nuanced consideration of the various biological and abiotic processes which can contribute to the remineralization of organic matter is often simplified to a balance between aerobic respiration and primary production, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \text{GPP}=\text{NCP}+\text{GR}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where GPP is gross primary production, NCP is net community production, and GR is gross (community) respiration. In the vast majority of cases, this is a logical and very useful simplification: The surface ocean is where photosynthesis takes place, and aerobic respiration by heterotrophic bacteria is the ultimate sink for particulate (Giering et al., 2014; Ploug and Grossart, 1999) and dissolved (Ar\'{i}stegui et al., 2002; Carlson and Ducklow, 1996) organic matter in virtually every major marine ecosystem (though, the state of the balance between the two processes is still hotly debated; e.g., del Giorgio and Duarte, 2002; del Giorgio et al., 1997; Ducklow and Doney, 2013; le B. Williams, 1998).

Yet, there is considerable evidence that select other processes which can degrade or remineralize organic matter may be significant in shaping both trophic balance in surface and pelagic ecosystems and the rate at which sinking marine particles are lost during their transit to the seafloor. First, several studies have shown that photochemical processes can directly oxidize some fractions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to inorganic forms at scales which are globally significant (Miller and Zepp, 1995; Mopper and Kieber, 2002; Mopper et al., 1991). This direct photochemical oxidation of DOC to CO$_2$ represents the extreme case in which a process other than aerobic respiration acts as the immediate and ultimate sink for fixed organic matter. The more profound significance of non-respiratory processes for ocean biogeochemistry can be seen in the many instances in which aerobic respiration or another biologically mediated oxidation reaction remains the ultimate sink for organic matter but one of these processes fundamentally facilitates the remineralization.

This is the case with photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter: In many instances, while only a small fraction of DOC is directly oxidized to CO$_2$, photochemical reactions make a more significant additional fraction available to bacteria by reducing complex, often recalcitrant molecules to smaller labile components (Kieber et al., 1989; Zafiriou et al., 2003). This more labile DOC can then be remineralized at rates that far exceed those achievable in the absence of photochemistry. The significance of indirect contributions to rates of remineralization by non-respiratory processes can also be seen in increasing evidence from sinking marine particles. While aerobic respiration by free-living and particle-attached bacteria remains the ultimate sink for marine snow, other processes such as ``sloppy feeding'' or mechanical disaggregation by zooplankton may prepare organic material for heterotrophic metabolism by rendering it more labile (Grossart et al., 2007; Stemmann et al., 2004). These processes can, in some instances, be highly significant (Giering et al., 2014). Photochemical processes may also act on particulate organic carbon in a manner similar to DOC (Rontani et al., 2012).

While the chapters in this thesis are largely the product of a number of separate research projects, they are therefore joined together by two primary themes: Each focuses on a process or processes which augment or facilitate the degradation of organic matter by respiration, and, in two instances, lipids and their oxidation products are explored as biomarkers to assess processes' significance and magnitude. In all cases, I have sought to combine oceanographic field experiments and traditional geochemical analyses with novel modeling and computational approaches. While lipids are the central focus of this work in a geochemical sense, the projects in this thesis span multiple domains of chemistry and depth within the ocean (\autoref{fig:c1n1}).

First, in \autoref{chap2}, I sought to determine the relative contribution to particle flux attenuation by respiration compared to the other major biological and mechanical processes that progressively remove sinking particles with depth (\autoref{fig:c1n2}). I first present measurements collected at six stations in North Atlantic basin of sinking particulate carbon fluxes, water column bacterial production and respiration rates, and specific respiration rates on sinking particle material. I then calculate substrate-specific respiration rates on sinking particles, bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) both in the water column and on sinking particle material, and depth-integrated estimates of water column BP and respiration for the upper mesopelagic zone (50 to 150 m). Finally, I apply the measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes and substrate-specific respiration in a series of sensitivity analyses of a simple, yet mechanistic model of particle flux attenuation. Observational data and the results of these sensitivity analyses are combined to (1) constrain the relative contribution to particle flux attenuation by particle-attached microbial respiration compared to other processes and (2) determine how differences in the average sinking speed of marine particles affect this partitioning.

In \autoref{chap3}, I present a new software package and computational strategy for discovering lipid, oxylipin, and oxidized lipid biomarkers in large volumes of high-resolution, accurate-mass HPLC-ESI-MS lipid data. I was inspired in developing the software by the need for new computational approaches to parse the increasingly complex dataset that are generated in metabolomics and lipidomics studies (Cajka and Fiehn, 2016; Prosser et al., 2014). Lipid and Oxylipin Biomarker Screening through Adduct Hierarchy Sequences, or LOBSTAHS, is centered around a novel screening methodology that exploits the unique tendency of lipids to form adduct ions in consistent, diagnostic patterns of abundance that remain relatively consistent across sample types. Using lipid data from cultures of a mutant strain of a marine diatom (\emph{Phaeodactylum tricornutum}) designed for studies of oxidative stress (van Creveld et al., 2015), LOBSTAHS is applied in \autoref{chap3} to resolve conflicting compound assignments, examine differential expression of compounds across experimental treatments, discover and identify potential oxidized intact polar lipid (ox-IPL) and oxylipin biomarkers, and identify potential isomers and isobars. In the experimental dataset, a stress response is induced in the \emph{P. tricornutum} by treating the cultures with hydrogen peroxide (H$_2$O$_2$), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be generated both biologically (e.g., as a consequence of metabolic activity) and abiotically (e.g., via photochemical reactions). H$_2$O$_2$ represents a persistent source of stress in many marine ecosystems.

In \autoref{chap4}, I explore the mechanisms and biogeochemical significance of lipid photooxidation in coastal surface waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula. The research in \autoref{chap4} was motivated by a paucity of information about the potentially complex relationships between ecosystem processes and the photochemical production of oxidized lipids and oxylipins induced by ultraviolet radiation (\autoref{fig:c1n3}). I combine results from experiments in a model liposome system with diverse environmental data --- including high-resolution, accurate-mass HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of lipid samples and in situ time-series measurements of ultraviolet irradiance --- to address several research objectives. By exposing liposomes to different light treatments under natural conditions, I sought to determine whether the photooxidation of intact polar diacylglycerols (IP-DAG; a broad class of membrane lipid) was dependent on molecular structure. Specifically, I hypothesized that a higher degree of unsaturation in the fatty acids of a particular IP-DAG would make it more amenable to photooxidation. As part of these experiments, I also investigated the effect of lipid photooxidation on natural communities of heterotrophic bacteria, and conversely, whether the presence of these bacteria would enhance apparent overall rates of lipid degradation. The diversity, quantities, and structures of various products of lipid photooxidation are queried by applying the data analysis methods described in \autoref{chap3} (Collins et al., 2016) to the HPLC-ESI-MS data from our liposome experiments. Using the same MS and data analysis methods, I also sought to characterize the lipidome of plankton from the WAP water column to determine what fraction of the particulate ($\geq$ 0.2 $\mu$m) lipid biomass would likely be amenable to degradation by photooxidation. Finally, I calculate broadband polychromatic apparent quantum yields (AQY) for photooxidation of IP-DAG under natural environmental conditions. These are applied to the water column lipid data and measurements of irradiance to estimate the significance of lipid photooxidation within the carbon cycle of the WAP ecosystem.

Finally, in \autoref{chap5}, I offer some new perspectives on the results and methods presented in the three main thesis chapters, and present some conclusions and directions for future research.

The thesis also contains several appendices: In \autoref{AppA}, I present a description and demonstration of the PHORCYS (PHOtosynthesis, Respiration, and Carbon-balance Yielding System), a new, incubation-based instrument that can be deployed in situ to determine rates of respiration and primary production in a wide range of marine and aquatic ecosystems. Development and testing of the PHORCYS was motivated by a surprising finding: Despite the attention that aerobic respiration has received relative to other processes that remineralize and degrade organic matter in the ocean, there are still far fewer total observations in the literature of respiration than primary production (\autoref{fig:c1n4}; le B. Williams and del Giorgio, 2005). Large discrepancies have also been observed between geochemical tracer and in vitro-based methods for measuring the net community productivity of marine ecosystems (le B. Williams et al., 2013). In \autoref{AppA}, respiration rate estimates from two versions of the PHORCYS are compared with estimates based a traditional method using Winkler titrations. A new method for estimating rates of error in metabolic rate measurements derived from dissolved oxygen time series is also presented. In \autoref{AppB}, I present some preliminary results from an experiment in which whole, unfiltered surface seawater samples from a site in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) were exposed to different qualities of natural radiation during a series of shipboard incubations. The lipidomics pipeline described in \autoref{chap4} is applied to samples from the experiment to discover patterns and biomarkers of lipid photooxidation. The additional appendices (\autoref{AppC}, \autoref{AppD}, and \autoref{AppE}) contain supporting information, including supplementary figures and tables, for the main thesis chapters.

In preparing this thesis, I was keenly aware of a widely-held perception that geoscientists have been slow to adopt many of the core tenets of open science (McNutt et al., 2016). Accordingly, I have endeavored to make all data, software, and code required to reproduce the results in this thesis publicly available in open-source or non-proprietary formats; instructions can be found in designated sections at the end of each chapter, or in the corresponding supporting information. I sincerely apologize that some of my earlier computations (for \autoref{chap2}) were performed in MATLAB. MATLAB is a great product, but it costs a considerable amount of money for those who don't have access to a site license. With this caveat, I have hewed as closely as possible to the guidelines established by the \href{http://www.scientificpaperofthefuture.org/gpf/what-is-a-gpf}{Geoscience Papers of the Future Initiative} for provenance and data and software availability.
